`main` - This branch contains the combined code from other branches. Please note that direct code pushes are not permitted; instead, contributors must create a pull request _with at least one approved review_.

When creating a new branch, adhere to the following convention: use `feature/<User Story Number>` for feature branches or `bugfix/<User Story Number>` if it is a bugfix branch.


>_Remember to always take a pull from the `main` branch before you start working on any feature or bug_
